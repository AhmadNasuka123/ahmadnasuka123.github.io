abstract: The meaning of love is far from what you think. Love is pure, holy and far from something that destroys love is a means for a servant to get closer to his God and not a representation of love that is too deep for the opposite sex. "True love gives, even if it is not reciprocated, it can still be sincere. Join in being happy when your beloved is happy. Often chanting prayers for the beloved, so that Allah bestows all goodness". Love has a broad meaning, the more it explains the definition of love, the more confused people are to understand it, all of that cannot be separated from someone's opinions and differences about defining love, the meaning of love is very broad.

# Summary. An optional shortened abstract.
